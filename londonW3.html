  <p> As the Internet of Things (IoT) market is continuously growing, the potential for smart city development has to be considered. Furthermore, protecting the environment is one of the most important challenges nowadays, thus a lot of consideration has to be put into maximizing the sustainability of a city. This is report seizing London’s potential for smart sustainable development. The piece is divided under three main sectors: smart waste, smart energy and smart water. The analysis is done based on the government’s initiative, as well as projects developed by major companies that seek innovation within the current system. Potential developments and issues are discussed that could eventually be integrated in a sustainability dashboard that manages the whole ecosystem.  </p>

<p> According to the Greater London Authority (GLA) the market for smart city technologies could reach 13.4bn US$ by 2020, which approximately represents 1% of the total global market. The study indicates that around half of the value, which is rounded to be 7bn US$, belongs to industry areas such as: smart waste, smart energy and waste management. In addition to this, smart transport and health assisted living have the same growing potential. However, this study focuses on the first three latter developments.</p>

    <p> For the past seven years, the City of London has developed a plan to ensure London’s permanent care and growth of the system that is taking care of managing the waste, under the initiative “The city of London Waste Strategy 2013-2020”.  In 2011 the Mayor creates a strategy, under the name “London’s Wasted Resource”, where the subsequent goals are followed:
    </p>

    <div class="w3-col m10 w3-margin-bottom">
      <div class="w3-green">

        <div class="w3-container">

          <p class="w3-text-white"> ■ Achieve zero municipal waste direct to landfill by 2025</p>
          <p class="w3-text-white"> ■ Reduce the amount of household waste produced in 2008/09 from 970kg to 790kg per household by 2031 </p>
          <p class="w3-text-white"> ■ Increase London’s capacity to reuse or repair municipal waste from approximately 6,000 tonnes per annum in 2008 to 40,000 in 2012 and 120,000 in 2031</p>
          <p class="w3-text-white"> ■ Recycle or compost at least 45% of municipal waste by 2015, 50% by 2020 and 60% 2031</p>
          <p class="w3-text-white"> ■ The management of London’s municipal waste to achieve annual greenhouse gas emissions savings of approximately: 1.2 million tonnes of CO2eq in 2015 1.4 million tonnes of CO2eq in 2020 1.6 million tonnes of CO2eq in 2031 </p>
          <p class="w3-text-white"> ■ To generate as much energy as possible from London’s organic and non-recyclable waste in a way that is no more polluting in carbon terms than the energy source it is replacing. This is estimated to be possible for about 40% of London’s municipal waste after recycling or composting targets are achieved by 2031</p>

    <p> Another strategy undertaken by the Mayor underlines the importance of managing the municipal waste locally in order to act accordingly to the maximum net self-sufficiency by 2031 goal disclosed in The London Plan. The latter strategy consists of six planning policies that involve waste issues across all London: </p>

<h3> Commercial Waste </h3>

<p> The Waste Management of the city is divided in two parts: commercial waste and residential waste. The commercial waste is not provided by a singular service, but with a series of operators which should have a contract with businesses in order to collect the respective waste.  The City of London recommends the following waste companies as appropriate collection points:</p>

<p> The chart above is based on a survey conducted by Defra and it displays the average household waste that is accumulated from either regular household collections, or non-household sources. It can be noticed a major decrease, under two million metric tons, of normal household waste in 2008/09. Additionally, the lowest amount of average household waste was marked in 2011/12. Compared to the latter category, it can be noticed that non-household waste is by more than half less. The year which marks the lowest dropdown for non-household waste is 2015/16 with only 508 tons. </p>

<p>Food waste sometimes is unavoidable, nevertheless, there are several things that could be done in order to diminish this issue. According to the government the average rubbish bin is filled a third with food waste. Moreover, the households are responsible for half of the total food waste in United Kingdom, followed by industries such as: supermarkets, factories and restaurants.

  <p> According to Arup’s study on of the main problems in the smart energy sector is the high use fossil fuels which leads to climate change. Consequently, in order to diminish this issue, London has to find new cleaner sources of energy. However, the price of fuel should not raise in order to be adapted by the consumers.

<p> Rio Tinto Group is Anglo-Australian leading mining group which focuses on "finding, mining and processing the Earth's mineral resources", according to the company's description. As a consequence, they produce iron, coppr, diamonds, gold and much more. The multinational company currently has it's organisatial centre in London, United Kingdom. Following the company's pressure from the inventors regarding the large greenhouse gas emissions, they set a net zero goal by 2050. The Rio Tinto Group commited to spending 1 billion US$ in order to cut down the emssions in the following five years. In the chart above a continous decrease can be noticed starting from the 2012 year. Furthermore, a decrease of 15 million metric tons occured over a duration of ten years, 2009-2019.   </p>


  <h3> How is climate change affecting London?</h3>

  <p>As we all know the climate is constantly changing. As a consequence, according to the UK government, the summers became hotter and drier, while the winters became warmer and wetter. These results are believed to be caused by people’s activities, which ultimately lead to emission of greenhouse gases (i.e. carbon dioxide).
  </p>

  <p> The government’s response to this issue involves reducing the city’s greenhouse gas emissions in order to stop additional developing, as well as adjusting to the new climate conditions.
  </p>

  <p> Firstly, in order to tackle the latter issue the Mayor set the goal for London to achieve a zero level of carbon by 2050. As found in the governmental research, 80% of the gas emissions are a result of powering and heating buildings by burning fossil fuels, while the remaining part results from transport. More information related to the Mayor’s initiative, London Environment Strategy, to solve this problem involves:

  <p> Secondly, the Mayor’s plan for adapting to the extreme climate changes that were previosly mentioned, involves taking into consideration the high risk sitations, such as floods, droughts and heat. The latter weather conditions are belived to be become more frequent and serious, if we do not step in. Therefore, in the Mayor’s plan for climate change, Managing Risks and Increasing Resilience, the following steps are explored:

  <p> Siemens initiative involves integrating smart energy within the energy supply as a more effective, secure and adaptable source. However, renewable supplies can be harder to integrate in the current structure. Therefore, Siemens proposes decentralized power generation and intelligent storage in order to permit society to control their electricity. Moreover, due to the growing usage of renewable energy power, the respective systems must be able of “managing multi-directional power flows, highly volatile power generation, and large variations in demand”. Thus, a smart infrastructure that can adapt the growing complexity of the model is sought. </p>

    <p>London’s water systems are mainly managed by four companies: Affinity Water, Thames Water, Essex and Suffolk Water, and Sutton and East Surrey Water. However, according to Arup’s study, Thames Water is responsible for approximately 80% of the city’s market.</p>
    <p>According to Thames Water, they established the largest and most effective water business in the United Kingdom. As a consequence, the programme involves collecting everyday 34 million litres of water in the 2015-2020 timeframe. In addition to this, Thames Water is involved in the <a href="https://www.water.org.uk/love-water/">Love Water Campaign</a>. The latter aims at raising awareness regarding current situation, as well as encouraging people to get involved in protecting it.

  <p>Under the digital utility section, it is argued that currently there are a range of companies based in the United Kingdom that are working on the revolution of water systems by collecting data. Therefore, as stated, by using “leading-edge modelling and analytics tools”, the companies can enhance the overall customer experience by adapting “asset and operational data into actionable insights”. As a consequence, the automation appliances can lead to a decrease of operational costs, while busting accuracy and effectiveness at their full potential.</p>




  <h3> How can analytic tools maximise efficiency? </h3>

<p> Analytic tools can allow water companies to imagine a variety of scenarios from user experience to business models. Thus, they can quickly apply it to the situation and enhance the analysis process. As stated, the latter tools can be applied to operational and investment enterprises, resulting in an innovative manner of controlling how water is handled.
